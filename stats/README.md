Description
===========


#### big_players.py

This script returns the big players of GSoC i.e. the orgs that are getting selected on a consistent basis.
Now you know which org you should keep an eye on for the next GSoC, don't you :wink:


#### org-count.py

This script returns the number of times a particular organization has been selected for GSoC with the corresponding years.


#### sameproj.py

This script returns those unique projects that were assigned to more than one student.
Well, its not just you, my head twirled as well when I first got to know about this, so relax :smile:


#### seniors.py

This script lists out the veterans of GSoC. The students who are getting selected in GSoC consistently.
Check it out, there is a guy who's getting selected for 6 times consecutively from 2009 - 2014 :astonished:
( And I'm eager to find if this guy was able to craxk it up this year as well :open_mouth:)


#### student-count.py

This script takes the handle of the student as an arguement and returns the number of times he has been selected for GSoC and the corresponding years as well.


Known Issues
============

#### org-count.py

I have not tested the script rigorously, moreover such a variety in the name of the organization may lead to inconsistent result.

TODO
====

* Test these scripts for rest of the data (2005-2009 and 2015)
* Write more such scripts. Cover other scenarios as well.( Hopefully we can think of them.)
